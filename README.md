# Code-Quiz

## Description

The Coding Quiz is website that offers a quiz to test your knowledge on programming. You have 60 seconds
to answer all the questions and your score is based on the number of questions you answer correctly.
Answering a question incorrectly will deduct 10 seconds from the timer.
At the end of the quiz, you are able to save your score to later allow you to compare your scores.

I was motivated to work on this project because it gave me the opportunity to expand my Javascript skills by using variables, functions, conditional logic, event handling and even some CSS.
